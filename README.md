# FastApi-StockScreener

This a small app that enables the user to get informations about stocks company through the Yahoo Finance Api.
Technologies used in this application are : 
SQLAlchemy and SQLite 
FastApi.
I explored briefly three main features of FastApi : Pydantic Models, Background Tasks and Dependency Injections.

This project is still under construction, the few next steps are:
  * Moving from a SQLlite to a PostgreSQL database
  * Working on a better UI
  * Enable the user to use company names as an input (instead of symbol).
